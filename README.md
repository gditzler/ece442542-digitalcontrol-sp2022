# ECE442-542 Digital Control Systems 

This repo contains scripts and example code that students might find useful 
for homework and projects enrolled in Digital Control Systems at the University 
of Arizona. 

# Getting set up

You need to have your Matlab paths set up correctly if you're planning on 
running the scripts from other directories. To do so, run `addpath('src/')` 
then you can run the code from an directory.
